## 🛠️ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (This Week)**

### **1. Frontend Project Setup**
```bash
# Create React application
npx create-react-app client --template typescript
cd client

# Install key dependencies
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
npm install react-router-dom
npm install axios
npm install @headlessui/react
npm install tailwindcss
```

### **2. API Integration Layer**
```typescript
// Create API client for frontend
class ApiClient {
  async login(credentials: LoginData): Promise<AuthResponse>
  async getWorkflows(): Promise<Workflow[]>
  async createWorkflow(workflow: WorkflowData): Promise<Workflow>
  async executeWorkflow(id: string): Promise<ExecutionResponse>
  async getExecutionStatus(id: string): Promise<ExecutionStatus>
}
```

### **3. Authentication Flow**
```typescript
// Frontend auth context
const AuthContext = createContext<{
  user: User | null;
  login: (credentials: LoginData) => Promise<void>;
  logout: () => void;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}>({});
```
